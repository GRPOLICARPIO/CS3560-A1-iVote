## iVote Simulator

A Java-based simulation tool based on the live poll idea (mentimeter) we used during the class.
This gives out a basic simulation of a voting system using object-oriented programming concepts and methods. More specifically, a student submit answers to a question and the results are tallied and displayed.

## Running my program:
- Download all necessary files to one directory.
- Compile the Java Files:

    Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and compile the Java files using the javac command:

      javac StudentInfo.java QuestionInfo.java VotingSystemService.java SimulationController.java
- Run the Program:

    After compiling, run the SimulationController class:

      java SimulationController
